# Rate-Monotonic-Scheduler
Rate Monotonic Scheduler using Atmega32, developed during my internship at AMIT. The scheduler assigns priorities to tasks based on their periodic rates, ensuring higher-frequency tasks meet their deadlines. This project demonstrates real-time task management and embedded C programming on microcontrollers.
